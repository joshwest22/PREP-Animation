<h1>Animation</h1>
<h2>How were those super awesome graph transitions made?</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Transition (.transition()) was used to carry out the animation. It evaluates every attr() immediately</li><br />
<li>Duration (.duration(miliseconds)) is used to determine the length of time of the animation</li><br />
<li>Easing (.ease()) is used to smoothly accelerate or decelerate through a transition</li><br />
<li>Bar graphs are made by using the d3 core algorithm and then appending a rect object</li><br />
<li>Fun Fact: Tooltips are SUPER easy to use and help discretely display simple information when hovering over different elements of the graph.</li><br />
</ul>
